/**
 * Detect and create the appropriate supervisor for the given executor.
 *
 * Called once when constructing a BareRuntime. The probe itself is the shared
 * `resolveEnvironment` one, memoized per executor, so this costs no round-trip of its own
 * on a target anything else has already looked at.
 *
 * Its two-condition systemd test — PID 1 is systemd *and* `systemctl` exists, because a
 * container can have the binary with no running init and a minimal install can have the
 * init with no binary — is the one the detector now applies for every caller. There used
 * to be three different tests in the repo and this was the correct one.
 *
 * Falling back to nohup when the answer is unknown is deliberate and safe — nohup works
 * everywhere — but it is not free: the workload stops surviving a reboot. So the fallback
 * is never silent when it was taken for lack of an answer rather than because the box
 * genuinely runs no systemd. That distinction was invisible before: an unmeasured host
 * reports `serviceManager: "none"`, which reads exactly like a measured macOS box.
