 * whether the Activity overview above still fits. This used to call
 * `/containers/issues` + `/containers/behind` and judge severity itself, which meant
 * the slot could only ever see edge and mail: a crash-looping container that had
 * already paged Telegram was invisible on the panel titled "Needs attention". One
 * read, one definition, and every source the feed grows reaches the home page free.
